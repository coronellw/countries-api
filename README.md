## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/) - Routing library for react
- [bootstrap](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles (Mostly for dropdown and containers)
- [fontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Library for Icons

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

- Handling error pages: Despite using `react-router-dom` to handle the errors in the site, it was not possible to display the error page within the chosen deployment site (vercel)
